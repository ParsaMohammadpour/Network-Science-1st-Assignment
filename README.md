# network-science
This was my network-science first assignment.

This assignment contains these 2 main parts:

**1. Analysing charles darwin book words distribution & comparing them with 3 famous graphs degree distribution:** <br />
&emsp; For this part the relevant code is in [charles_darwin_book](https://github.com/ParsaMohammadpour/Graph-1st-Assignment/blob/main/charles_darwin_book.ipynb) notebook file.
And from this file we can conclude that the distribution of words in charles darwin book is similar to scale-free (barabasi-albert graph in the code). So the distribution of words book are power-low distribution.
	
**2. Applying failure on 3 famous graphs:** <br />
&emsp; For this part the relevant code is in [graph_failures](https://github.com/ParsaMohammadpour/Graph-1st-Assignment/blob/main/graph_failures.ipynb) notebook file.
Also there is another version for this topic, failure comparison, which is more persice bacause all these 3 graphs (small-worlds, scale-free & randoms) in which they have same node number and same degree mean. This repo name is [Graph-Failure-Comparison](https://github.com/ParsaMohammadpour/Graph-Failure-Comparison).
